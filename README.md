# Description

The app uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve informations on movies, tv series and their individual episodes. Among others things, the information includes the name, description, IMDb rating and a link to the poster of the film/series.

A user is able to search for any media and view this information, as well as save individual movies/series to his watch later list.
